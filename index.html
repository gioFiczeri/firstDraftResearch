<p1 style= "font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"> Alois Riegl is regarded by many as one of the core founders of the study of architecture as a discipline. Riegl was a vocal opponent of the preconceived notions of art and its evaluation of style simply being the sum of the materials and techniques chosen to create a particular work-and a reflection of the natural world, and was the subject of scrutiny in his first book, Problems of Style: Foundations for a History of Ornament (1893). Riegl believed that “art responds to an artistic, creative drive which is immanent to the work of art itself”, that the concept of art was instead an intrinsic will to create for the sake of creation as opposed to organization. This idea of form not being dictated by function would serve as the basis for Riegl’s (in)famous concept of Kunstwollen. Simply put, the Kuntswollen is the “will to art” as mentioned previously. Riegl would incorporate this theory into the basis of all his evaluations of art and specifically architecture of ancient societies. Due to the vague nature of Kunstwollen as it applies to architecture, the term went through many renovations by Riegl until it was finally settled to be the direct relationship between all domains of life at a given moment. To further give credence to his theory and how it can be applied in architectural evaluation, Riegl proposed the Three Concepts of Space;<a href="nahsicht">Nahsicht</a> , <a href="normalsicht">Normalsicht</a>, and <a href="fernsicht">Fernsicht</a>.
