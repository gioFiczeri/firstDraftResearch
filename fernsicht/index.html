  <h2 style="text-align: left;"> Fernsicht buildings are meant to be viewed from afar, possess optic qualities, and place an emphasis on colors, shadows, and depth perception.</h2>

A culmination of ideas from both nahsicht and normalsicht, the fernsicht concept proposed by Riegl recognizes full three-dimensionality. Space and depth are now fully acknowledged but as opposed to containing it as was the case in normalsicht, but instead defining it. This allows for near-infinite space, just as long as the space is enclosed between itself, which is similar to the solidity of nahsicht architecture.
There was a new emphasis on constructing buildings in a way that it continues for as long as the viewer is willing to travel along its edge. This was usually done through circular rooms with no section being the "main" portion of that room. We also see a sort of revival of the dome, as it accentuates this infinite space by allowing the roof to continue upwards until its apex which was usually cut out. This can be seen as an insinuation of the dome reaching the heavens or simply continuing past its physical end. The introduction of the portico also attributes to the three dimensionality and infinite plane of the fernsicht. Due to its massive columns in proportion to the entrance, the rooms adjacent to the portico appear to grow in size as you walk through it, opening up to the endless ceilings as previously mentioned.
