  <h2 style="text-align: left;"> Normalsicht buildings are meant to be viewed from an intermediate distance, have both tactile and optic qualities, and emphasize figures and ground</h2>

  <p1 style= "font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 40px">
Normalsicht is the perfect middle ground between its predecessor- nahsicht, and its successor- fernsicht. Here in the normalsicht period of architecture we see the beginning of an acceptance of depth and spatial awareness in regards to plane. This is immediately apparent in the buildings' exteriors, particularly in the relief sculptures adorning them, commonly found in pediments and friezes. These reliefs protrude outward from the structure, creating depth through shadow and of course optical perception of near and far. There is also a tactile nature in having relief sculptures, as they now exhibit textural qualities that move beyond the inherent texture of the material being used. There is also significance of the introduction of the colonnade surrounding the periphery of these structures. This implementation allows for some visibility to the interior of the structure- a feature not present in the nahsicht concept of spatial antiquity-creating a whole new dimensionality and depth to the perception of the building. Not only is this a physical characteristic, but societal as well, as buildings are no longer pushing people away (although buildings were still only truly accessible by those allowed) and creating a sense of “off-limits”, but instead inviting their gaze and being accessible in the sense of being physically able to walk up and inside the building. There is an insistence on containing space, as there is still a defined ‘edge’ to the structure where its clear the building stops and the outside begins, although because of the columns and the extended ground plane, we can interpret an invitation to bring these spaces together, yet still maintain a tangible separation.
