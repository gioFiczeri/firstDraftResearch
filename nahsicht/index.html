  <h2 style="text-align: left;"> Nahsicht refers to buildings that are meant to be viewed up close, have haptic qualities, and emphasize physical planes and silhouette</h2>

  <p1 style= "font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 40px">
As it relates to the concepts of space Riegl described in his book Late Roman Art, nahsicht architecture should be considered a “Bildwerk rather than a bauwerk”- meaning that nahsicht structures are more sculpture than building-they exist more for the spectacle and aesthetic value rather than actual function. This can be made evident by the their simple physical qualities, especially those concerned with facade and scale. The general aesthetic qualities of nahsicht architecture are the same regardless of which side you are viewing from, which accentuates its usage of a continuous plane. This continuous plane and size makes it so that-when viewed from up close as intended-it is impossible to see around the structure, all that exists is what you can see in front of you.
Another quality that exemplifies the nahsicht categorization by Riegl is the complete lack of a view through the building. It exists as a completely solid object, with no windows or passages that would allow the viewer to see its interior operations and form without venturing inside. This coincides with the complete disregard for function in its overall form, as when looking at a section cut of the pyramid, we can see that actual inhabitable space accounts for very little of the overall structure. In sum, the kunstwollen of this particular structure and time period was to create the “closest possible approximation of the material appearance of the work of art to the plane”. This was achieved by creating a self contained structure, wherein everything beyond it acts as void.
